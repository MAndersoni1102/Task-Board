# Task-Board
This task board is built to create and manage your tasks and when they are due.
This uses Javascript and a modal to create new tasks using multiple functions. You can add a task, the date its due, and a short description of the task you need to complete. This task board also highlights your tasks based on the date they are due with either a yellow or a red background.
